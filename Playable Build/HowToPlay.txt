After your playtest, consider the below questions when reviewing:

Are there any moments as you played where you had confusion on what to do in regard to basic combat and puzzle mechanics?

Is the game balanced enough in regards to the combat being a bullet hell, and the puzzles being intuitive and completable with sufficient effort?

Any parts of the game that required more visual or further direct guidance?
